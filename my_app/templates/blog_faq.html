      Registration is required as part of the sampling process. It enables us to send the results of testing to you. Without registration, results will not be provided. Once the sampling process has occurred, registering the kit registration ID is necessary. Follow the instructions provided with the blood test kit to carry registration out.

      You should receive an email confirming your registration was successful. If you are unsure, please try to register again as the site will not allow you to register the same kit twice. Please note that it is the customer's responsibility to ensure that their personal details filled are correct as this may prevent the registration notification and subsequent reports of results coming through.
